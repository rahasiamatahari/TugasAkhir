    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TL;DR: [**earthaccess**](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess) is a Python package to search, preview and access NASA datasets (on-prem or in the cloud) with a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Programmatic, Easy, Reproducible.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to access NASA datasets, we can use the [Earthdata search portal](https://search.earthaccess.nasa.gov/). We can use DAAC specific portals or tools.\n",
    "We could even use [data.gov](https://data.gov)!  Web portals are great but they are not designed for programmatic access and reproducible workflows. This is extremely important in the age of the cloud and reproducible open science. \n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that NASA also exposes APIs that allows us to search, transform and access data in a programmatic way. Many of these libraries contain amazing features and some similarities. In this context, **earthaccess** aims to be a simple library that can deal with the important parts of the metadata so we can access or download data without having to worry if a given dataset is on-prem or in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: There are a lot of acronyms that we need to get familiar with before any of this makes sense, here is a brief glossary for NASA Earthdata terms: [NASA glossary](glossary.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication: Before we can use `earthaccess` we need an account with **[NASA EDL](https://urs.earthaccess.nasa.gov/)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Earthdata Login provides free and immediate access to thousands of EOSDIS data products covering all Earth science disciplines and topic areas for researchers, applied science users, application developers, and the general public.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our NASA EDL login credentials we can start accessing NASA data in a programmatic way.\n"
